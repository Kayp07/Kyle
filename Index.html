        <h2>Languages</h2>
        <p>With over 60 million South Africans and 12 official languages nationwide, one can only imagine the challenge many companies are currently facing. The diverse languages makes it so much more difficult considering these are our countries languages excluding foreign nationals which adds to an extra dyanmic. To teach a nation we need to start from the grass roots level. Simplicity is key, hence why I kept the website simple & user friendly.</p>
